# README

In this class I am hoping to get a foundational introduction to operating systems. I am specifically excited about the latter part of the course where we will work with network systems. I have used Git in CIT 591 as well as in my work as a data analyst at Cerner. I have no background in using Vagrant. My only experience using a VM is in AWS.
